# Internet Research Agency v2
If we were to organize our own IRA, how would we do it? The mission statement is
probably to cause maximal political interference for minimal cost, and being
detected by a few people probably isn't a big deal. The primary objective is to
push the general tone of the conversation, or lend credibility to a set of
viewpoints.

The first question is probably who we'd hire. We need Internet-savvy people who
can hold their own on Reddit (and ideally know their way around), so college
students or similar would be good. Turnover is also ok, and probably inevitable
given that they're millennials.

Owning a troll account isn't free because huge gaps in post history is probably
a bad thing -- so someone would need to post intermittently to maintain it. This
means two things:

1. In absolute terms, the IRA doesn't operate a huge number of troll accounts
2. Any given account will probably be managed by multiple humans

The [IRA page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency) suggests
that accounts are somewhat consistently assigned to users who work 12-hour
shifts every couple of days, but this seems suboptimal. I'd be surprised if we
found that type of consistency; we can look for it by finding accounts whose
posts match that submission pattern.

There are a few ways we could measure troll performance:

1. Post/comment score
2. General engagement with posted things
3. Engagement from users the troll replies to

**TODO:** more structure around this; what can we observe externally?
